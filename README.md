# Hey, I'm Kasra.

Making the world better, one thoughtful solution at a time.

---

I'm a builder with the vision of a product designer and the precision of an architect. I see how things could be, then build systems that scale. Some of the code I've written now runs in the hands of millions.

I also build frameworks on the side — because some problems are too interesting not to solve properly.
